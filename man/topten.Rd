\title{Build linear prediction model from top ten predictive features}
\usage{
topten(x,y)
}
\arguments{
    \item{x}{a matrix of at least ten columns of data}
    \item{y}{a vector of same length as x containing the outcomes for the data in x}
}
\value{
a numeric vector of coefficients generated by the linear model fit to x.
}
\description{
For matrix x of at least ten columns, and vector y of outcomes, builds a linear prediction model using the top ten predictive features in x chosen by p value.
}
\examples{
coeffs <- topten(x,y)
